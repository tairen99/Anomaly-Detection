# Anomaly-Detection

This project is targeting on Bird Audio Detection. You can derive the data from the official site: the BAD challenge: http://machine-listening.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/bird-audio-detection-challenge/.

This is an interesting project. You will monitor whether birds appear in the forest or not, so you can track the bird's migration and understand how temperature changes may affect the birds.

My first attempt is based on the Extra-Trees Classifier Isolation Forest method.
