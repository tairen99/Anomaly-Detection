# Anomaly-Detection

This project is target on Bird Audio Detection. You can derive the data from the official cite: the BAD challenge: http://machine-listening.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/bird-audio-detection-challenge/. 

This is an interesting project. You will monitor whether birds appear in the forest or not, so you can track the birds migration and understand how temperature changes may affect the birds.

My first attemp is based on the Extra Trees Classifier Isolation Forest method.
